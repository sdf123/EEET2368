EEET2368
========

This repository contains code for RMIT EEET2368 - Network Fundamentals &amp; Applications

The solutions may not be correct and the code is intended to be used to assist others in finding a possible solution.

Copying this code verbatim is probably not a good idea because:

1. There is a fair chance it doesn't work
2. Since it's here on the interwebs it is pretty easy to work out where you got it from
3. Yes, that is my real name, also the same name I use when submitting my assignments
