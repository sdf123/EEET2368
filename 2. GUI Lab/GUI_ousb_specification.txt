==================  GUI for Open-USB-IO Lab Exam  =====================================

PURPOSE     This file defines the GUI for Open-USB-IO lab exam,  it is not a proforma
            where you add code,  just a specification.
            Note also the marking proforma used by the tutors to evaluate your work,
            see the file GUI_marking_guide_2368.xls


BACKGROUND: Most products require GUI programs both for legitimate operational
            reasons and to help sales.  In this project you will be building a GUI
            for the Open-USB-IO board.


SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 

  * The program must be written using Eclipse and Qt 4 Designer using the
    lab test live-DVDs.

  * The main GUI screen must clearly state your name and student ID.

  * Marks will come from a pleasing layout on the screen and the number of
    features you can implement from the list below.

  * At the end of the lab exam you must copy the executable code,
    most likely in something like-
    /home/user/Documents then hit the submit button on the desk top.

  * Features to consider implementing are listed below.  You are
    not expected to implement every item.

      - An "about" must describe in text what you have achieved.  This
        will help the tutor find everything you have done.
        Ideally this will be from the menu with hot key ctrl-A but
        just a text box on the main screen is OK.
        *** An achievement not listed in this box may not be marked.

      - A timer must cause the status of Open-USB-IO to be read every
        second and the display should be updated.

      - The status of the 8 switches must be clear.

      - It must be possible to see the value of the LEDs and write
        to the LEDs.  Can you do this graphically with buttons?

      - Display the status of the LDR and pot.  Ideally the display
        will be graphical.

      - Set PWM 1, 2 and 3.

      - Display the analogue values on the 6 free analogue ports.

      - Display a primitive chart recorder of the switches or
        trim pot.  Consider a text box where each second a new
        row of 1s and 0s from the switches is added at the first
        line or appended at the bottom line.

      - Features and ideas NOT in the qt demo programs will
        rate more highly than those from the qt demo programs.



HINTS

  * The lectures will not have had time to work through the User Interface
    Design  notes.  It would be well worth reading these yourself so
    you have some idea what makes a good and bad interface.

  * The live-DVD Eclipse example programs have most of the code you
    will need and these examples will be on the lab test live-DVD.
    Make sure you know where to get which bits of code.

  * Do not modify an existing Qt GUI project, at least copy it so the
    original code is left intact as a reference.
      - In Eclipse ensure you have just one project open in the
        Project Explorer.
      - Right click on the project head and select copy, right
        click again and select paste,  supply a meaningful name.
      - Close the old working project, and start working on the
        new one.

  * Some students have reported the live-DVD crashes when compiling
    with debugging on. To move between the debug and release modes
    select the Eclipse menu option Project->Make Target, Build then
    double click or Release or Debug.
    You may need to add a space to the .cpp file and save to force
    the build to recompile.

  * The Open-USB-IO manual has many examples of useful commands that
    your GUI can issue.

  * You will need to practice this lab at home quite a lot to get
    it right.

  * Be very careful to save working versions of your code as the
    lab exam proceeds so you are not left with a dud program
    just as you must submit.
    Another essential approach is to add only a few lines before
    compiling and running.

  * After the lab exam you will receive a filled in marking sheet
    and your binary from the marking tutor (who will not be your
    normal tutor).  If you wish to challenge the mark you must
    email the tutor on their E number (e12345@ems.rmit.edu.au),
    refer to a row in the marking spreadsheet,  and clearly state
    why you think the mark is wrong.  It is very unlikely that
    a mark upgrade such as 12/20 to 15/20 will be accepted because
    the tutors will have marked to a consistent level for all
    students and changing jsut one would thus be wrong.




TUTOR MARKING INSTRUCTIONS

  * Well before the lab exam organize with another lab tutor to swap
    lab exams.
    Send your student's files to this tutor immediately after the lab
    session.
    The marking tutor should mark ASAP and sent the result to 
    directly to the students ASAP after the last lab session of the week.

  * Note that the marking is in points not percent!
    The conversion rate between points and marks % will be decided
    by the lecturer after all GUI lab exams have been done.

  * Tutors should use the live-DVD to mark the projects.

  * To start marking first open a copy of the marking guide-
      GUI_marking_guide_2368.xls
    Run the student's program and get their name and student number,
    cut and paste these into the marking guide and save under
    the student's number,  use name format:  s1234567_lab2.xls

  * Proceed to evaluate the student's program based on information in
    the about box and your use of the student's program.
    Take into account student's statements about whether
    a feature fully works or has defects.  Be harsh on defects you
    find that the student does not admit in the about information.
    Always write something in the comments section even if it is brief.

  * Note the "General Marking Guidelines" at the end of the lab guide.
    Features that were not in the demo programs should rate more 
    highly than those in the demo program.

  * When finished save the mark guide for this student.
    Add the mark to Blackboard.

  * Send all marking guide documents to the students as soon as 
    possible after the last lab session for this lab exam.
    >>>> It is VITAL to do this as some students may have a 2nd
         chance lab test the next day.

  * Keep a copy of all student marks in case of disputes.
    At the end of semester zip up all your marking results plus 
    student code and send them to the lecturer.
